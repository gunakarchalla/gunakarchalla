I am Gunakar Challa, a MS CS student at University of Bern. I have active knowledge in SAP Integration, application development, machine learning (including Deep Learning), databases (SQL & NoSQL), and object-oriented programming. Also, I have good problem-solving skills and communication skills (both verbal and written). I'm curious to acquire new skills that help me build my career and personality as well.
